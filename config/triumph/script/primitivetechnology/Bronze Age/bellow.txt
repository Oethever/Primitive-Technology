It must be powered by mechanical power (wooden axle) from below. The mechanical power must be alternating: a redstone clock must periodically stop the axle (gearboxes can be controlled by redstone for that reason). Without redstone, you can also do it manually with a button.\n\nBellows can also be used to push items by blowing air at them, in that case the mechanical power need not to be alternating.")
