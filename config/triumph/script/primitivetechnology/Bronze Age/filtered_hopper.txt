Filters can be added in the top slots, with differents behaviors:\n\n * Grate: let pass unstackable items\n * Iron bars: let pass stackable items\n * ladder: let pass items, not blocks\n * Slats: let pass string and paper only\n * Trap door: let pass blocks, not items\n * Wicker: let pass dust, piles and sand\n * Soul sand: collects experience orbs (also works unpowered, but with smaller orbs only)")
