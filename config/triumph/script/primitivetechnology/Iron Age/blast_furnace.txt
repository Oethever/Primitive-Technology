setDescription("The blast furnace is a furnace with even higher temperature than the bloomery, and is used to create steel from iron and coal coke. Place 27 blast brick blocks in a 3x3x3 shape, and right-click with the engineer hammer on the middle block. This multiblock has a GUI like the coke oven, simply place iron ingots and coal coke in it. Charcoal can be used, but is 4 times less efficient than coal coke. You obtain steel, and slag as a byproduct. It also works with whole blocks (a block of iron and a block of coal coke) at a time.")
