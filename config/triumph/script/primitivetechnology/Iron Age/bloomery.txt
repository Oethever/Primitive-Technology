Once completed, you can add ores (up to 32) and coal (1 coal per 2 ores) by tossing them in the chimney. Tossed ores should transform in a dark blend. Then, light up the bloomery by either right-click on the hatch with a flint and steel, or lighting on fire the block in front of the hatch (such that the flame is in front of the hatch).\n\nMinimal structure (B for bricks, H for hatch, A for air):\nLayer 0:\n AAA\n ABA\n ABA\nLayer 1:\n ABA\n BAB\n BHB\nLayers 2 to 4:\n ABA\n BAB\n ABA")
