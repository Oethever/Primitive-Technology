No block in chests, they are too big! You will need alternate storage solutions.\n\nItems are not picked up automatically when you approach. Instead, you can pick them up with R (configurable, defaults to right click if no key is bound), or by sneaking. You will need to drop stacks often, so make sure to have an easy key binding for that. Don't worry, items take one hour to despawn (instead of 5 minutes in vanilla).")
