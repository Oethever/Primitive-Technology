# Primitive Technology

_This modepack is in alpha, and has not a lot of content just yet. More will be added later._

### Description
This pack is inspired from the Youtube channel of the same name, and aims to provide realistic challenges to achieve basic levels of technology, and fun role-playing potential. **This modpack changes a lot of mechanics, it is the opposite of a kitchen-sink modpack! You've been warned.**

### Main aspects
 * Only 2 inventory slots, you only have two hands! (plus the offhand slots for early 3-items recipes). Bakcpacks and toolbelts are available.
 * Limited stack size (16 for blocks, 32 for items)
* You can carry and move blocks without destroying them
 * If you want to build a massive stone castle, you will need proper logistics (e.g. rail carts, horse carts, player carts) to extract stone from mines
 * No block in chests ! How do you want to fit 64 m³ of dirt in a 2 m³ chest?
 * Fine-tuned progression from stone age to industry, with consistent mod integration and re-written advancement tree.
 * No one-block-machines, all machines are multiblocks (charcoal pit, coke oven, kiln, bloomery, blast furnace, etc...)
 * Realistic progression based on real-life characteristics of ores (iron and aluminum are more difficult to make than copper and gold)
