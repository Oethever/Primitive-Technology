# Primitive Technology

### Description
This pack is inspired from the Youtube channel of the same name, and aims to provide realistic challenges to achieve basic levels of technology, and fun role-playing potential.

### Main aspects
 * Only 2 inventory slots, you only have two hands! (plus the offhand slots for early 3-items recipes)
 * Limited stack size (16 for blocks, 32 for items)
 * If you want to build a massive stone castle, you will need proper logistics (e.g. rail carts) to extract stone from mines
 * No block in chests ! How do you want to fit 64 m³ of dirt in a 2 m³ chest? (no yet implemented though, if you know a mod achieve that, let me know)
 * Fine-tuned progression from stone age to industry, with consistent mod integration
 * Charcoal is created in charcoal pit, and it takes some time!
 * Iron cannot be smelted in small wood-fueled furnace, you need a proper bloomery with updraft and charcoal to achieve a high enough temperature

### Main technology mods
 * Charcoal Pit
 * Better With Mods (with more realistic recipes, e.g. no nether)
 * Immerisive Engineering
 * Tinker Constructs

### Main decoration mods
 * Bibliocraft
 * Zoo and Wild Animals
 * More to come
